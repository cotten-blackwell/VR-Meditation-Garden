# VR-Meditation-Garden

This is a work in progress -- a Cardboard app for iOS that my daughter and I are pair programming.  

We want to give folks a 10-minute stress break in a beautiful setting that we've curated from our own original photography.  Also, there's an audio option for a master mindfulness practitioner to lead our guests step-by-step through a guided meditation.
